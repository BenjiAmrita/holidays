# Sport Climbing in the Franconian Jura

## [Jubiläumswand](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/frankenjura/jubilaumswand)

The Jubiläumswand is a perfect starting wall for the first days on rock in UIAA difficulty 4 and upwards.
Park on the country road near a bridge marked by a small transformation house.
The 5-minute approach to the crag is very entertaining.
