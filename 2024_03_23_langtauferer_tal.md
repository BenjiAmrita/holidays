# Ski Touring in Langtauferer Tal

For a wonderful stay with delicious food and a sauna experience in a family-run hotel,
we recommend the [Langtaufererhof](https://www.langtaufererhof.it/)
in the very quiet and remote Langtauferer valley.

- Towards Mittereggspitze from Perwang, stopped at Ochsenberg Alm
- Hausberg above decommissioned lift Maseben, located a bit to the right (West) of the track towards Tiergartenspitze / Mitterlochspitze
- WeiÃŸseejoch ðŸ˜®
- Glockhauser ðŸ˜Š
