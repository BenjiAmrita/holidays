# Simple Sport Climbing Oberammergau

## Marxersteig

Very easy but rewarding, silent and quickly drying slab climbing facing south-west.
Simple and fast approaching from Oberammergau.
Good for first making multi-picth experience.

A bit noisy due to nearby road.
Approaching not as easy as expected.

Difficult approach from south (Ropes needed for kids)
