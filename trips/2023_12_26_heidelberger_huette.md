# Ski Touring Course at the Heidelberger Hütte (2264)

A balanced mix of sunshine and ice-cold wind, powdered with nightly snow showers,
combined with avalanche warning level 2 of 5 offered us a great basis
to learn ski touring from our mountain guide at the [Heidelberger Hütte](https://www.heidelbergerhuette.at/).

## Larainferner Spitze (3009)

Starting from the Hütte, we skinned up through beautiful alpine terrain.
The last meters of the climb to Larainferner Spitze were challenging,
but the views at the top were breathtaking.

## Zahnjoch (~ 2946)

The traverse to Zahnjoch was a breeze in comparison—easy peasy.
Descent was a blast—riding through powder fields.

The group members were great, making the journey even better.
We trained hard to rescue pips from avalanches.
Definitely an unforgettable experience!
